# React photography website

This is a simple React portfolio website featuring content and route animations powered by Framer Motion. It includes a custom cursor with a mask hover effect that reveals negative text/images underneath. This effect is implemented through a custom hook that tracks the mouse position and assigns it to a div that follows the cursor around. The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
