# React photography website

This is a simple React portfolio website that showcases content and route animations using Framer Motion. The site also has a custom cursor with a mask hover effect revealing negative text/image underneath. This is achieved by creating a custom hook to get the position of the mouse and assigning it to a div that is used to follow the cursor around. 
The application uses tailwind CSS for styling.
